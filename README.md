Edge computing: A way of distributing computational tasks over a bunch of nearby processors (i.e., computers) that is good for speed and resiliency and does not depend on a single source of computational power

Data stewardship: The practices of an organization that ensure that data is accessible, usable, and safe

Personally identifiable information (PII): Information that permits the identity of an individual to be inferred by either direct or indirect means

Data anonymization: The process of protecting people's private or sensitive data by eliminating PII

Aggregate information: Data from a significant number of users that has eliminated personal information

The following suggestions are best practices for writing prompts for LLMs:
* Be clear and concise in your instructions. It is important to be clear and concise in your instructions so the LLM can understand how to help you. Details are great—just make sure they’re useful and relevant. Avoid giving the LLM unnecessary information.  
* Be precise. When posing a question to an LLM, be precise about the input (if any) and the desired output.
* Include a description of LLM’s role. This reinforces the purpose of your prompt. For example, you can tell the LLM to assume the role of a data scientist by writing “Act as a data scientist” or “You are a data scientist.”
* Provide context. Providing context allows the LLM to understand the nuances of the relevant issue and generate more informed responses.
* Try multiple prompts. Trying different prompts can provide different perspectives on a problem and enable the LLM to generate a variety of useful responses.

To help get you started, consider the following specific examples of prompts that data professionals can give an LLM:

“Act as a data scientist and write a detailed plan for a credit card fraud detection project.”

“I have a dataset of customer purchases at an online retail store. Act as a data scientist and write Python code for data visualization and exploration.”

“I have a dataset of customer characteristics and churn for an online video streaming service. Act as a data scientist and create a shared document for a team meeting.” 

“Act as a data generator and use Python code to generate a CSV file that contains mock employee data for a restaurant chain named Fast. The dataset has 100 rows and 5 columns. The columns are name, address, employee_id, department_id, email.”

“Act as a communications expert and share best practices for explaining a data science report to a business executive with no technical background.”
